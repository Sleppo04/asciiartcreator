# asciiartcreator
This is an ASCII-art creator written in Java.
It takes Images and outputs text-files.

There are runnable JAR-files, but I cannot guarantee that they are up-to-date with the code,
so it is recommended to compile the sourcecode yourself.

Also: no color as of now.
I'm working on ANSI-Color-support, and Maybe also HTML-Output.
